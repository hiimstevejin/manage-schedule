# Manage Schedule
## An open-source scheduling application built with Next.js that simplifies booking meetings and appointments by integrating directly with your Google Calendar. Create custom events, share a link, and let others book a time that works for them.

## Live Demo: https://manage-schedule.vercel.app/

# ‚ú® Core Features
### üìÖ Create Custom Events: Define event details like name, duration, and description. Set your availability for each event type.

### üîó Shareable Booking Links: Generate a unique link for each event type to share with anyone you want to meet with.

### ü§ù Seamless Booking for Invitees: Users visiting your link can see your available time slots and book a meeting in just a few clicks.

### üîÑ Real-Time Google Calendar Integration: Once a time slot is booked, the event is automatically created in your Google Calendar, complete with event details and attendee information. This ensures your availability is always up-to-date and prevents double bookings.

### üòé Clean & Simple UI: A modern, intuitive interface for both the event creator and the person booking the meeting.

npm or yarn

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone
cd <your-repo-name>

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root of the project by copying the example file.

cp .env.example .env

Next, populate the .env file with your credentials. You will need to create a Google Cloud project to get Google Calendar API keys and configure your authentication provider (e.g., Clerk).

Run the development server:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

# üîë Environment Variables
